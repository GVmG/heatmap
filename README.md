# osu! Beatmap Heatmap
A simple program to visualize a heatmap of the note positions in your [osu!](http://osu.ppy.sh/) beatmap, so you can tell which areas of the playfield the player will be around the most.


# Usage
It's extremely easy to use: just click the button to open a file, or just paste the filepath in the textbox, and the program will automatically draw the heatmap.
You can pick from different settings on the right, like how the program will render the heatmap, what objects it should render, etc.


# Basic Features
(that I still didn't add - but am working hard on implementing, like right now)
- make everything actually work (as of now it's just a pretty form)
- soft, circle, point heatmapping
- loading map info
- ability to ignore certain hitobject types (so maybe you could only watch sliders, or just notes, or... just spinners, I guess)


# Features to Come
- color heatmapping
- actually account for sliderbodies
- ability to only lok at the heatmap in a part of the map (as opposed to just the whole map)
- anything useful really (hmu on Discord @GV#5559 if you have a request!)
